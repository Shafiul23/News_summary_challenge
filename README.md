# News Summary Challenge

This challenge was my first time "Thinking in React", creating a website in which users could scroll through and see the headlines of the day, as well as being able to click on them to get a summary of the story. Clicking on the headline / image again would then direct the user to the Guardian website where they could find more information on the story. The page was designed using ReactJS and received the news by making requests to the Guardian API. 

### User stories
```
As a busy politician
So I know what the big stories of the day are
I can see all of today's headlines in one place
```

```
As a busy politician
So that I have something nice to look at
I can see a relevant picture to illustrate each news article when I browse headlines
```

### Extended

```
As a busy politician
So that I can get an in depth understanding of a very important story
I can click a news headline to see a summary and a photo of the news article
```

```
As a busy politician
So I can get a few more details about an important story
I can see click a news article summary title which links to the original article
```

## API

### API request rate limits and stubbing

The Guardian and Aylien text summarisation APIs are severely rate-limited.

**Please stub your tests so you don't exceed the daily limit.  Otherwise, all requests will be rejected and your app will stop working!**

### Guardian API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to get the content of an article from the Guardian API, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has a query parameter for `api-key`.

```sh
# Search endpoint
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=coronavirus&show-fields=body&api-key=API_KEY"
```
```sh
# Single Item endpoint
curl "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/mar/22/link-between-diabetes-and-coronavirus-infections?show-fields=body&api-key=API_KEY"
```

#### Example request data

[Mock Data](./mockNewsData.json) - contains a request to the Guardian API with fields selected that will help you with the challenge.  The actual request made was to:

https://content.guardianapis.com/search?order-by=newest&show-fields=byline%2Cthumbnail%2Cheadline%2CbodyText&api-key=INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE

You will need to replace `INSERT_YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your own Guardian API key.  Use this data whilst developing, serving it from `json-server` - it will help on the request rate limit in the API.

### Aylien text summarisation API example

**Please stub your tests to avoid exceeding the API rate limit**

If you wanted to use the Aylien API to summarise an article by Bret Victor, this is the cURL request you might make.  Notice how it has headers to authenticate with the Aylien API.

```
curl "https://api.aylien.com/api/v1/summarize?url=http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/note.html" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-ID: APPLICATION_ID" \
  -H "X-AYLIEN-TextAPI-Application-Key: SECRET_APPLICATION_KEY"
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
